# Atm-Backend-Code
We can construct an ATM in Java to illustrate ATM transection. The user must choose an option from the alternatives given on the screen in the ATM application. Withdraw money, deposit money, check your balance, and exit are the options available.  To withdraw money, we simply obtain the user’s withdrawal amount, deduct it from the total balance, and print the successful message.  To deposit money, we simply ask the user for the deposit amount, add it to the total balance, and print the successful message.  To check the balance, we simply publish the user’s total balance.  To exit the current Transaction mode and return the user to the home page or initial screen, we use the exit(0) method.

Download the all files and do the following:-

Type 'javac MyFirstJavaProgram.java' and press enter to compile your code
than Type 'java MyFirstJavaProgram.java' to run the code on the machine
